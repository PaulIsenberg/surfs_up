## Challenge Analysis for Seasonal Data

## In order to assess the impact of seasonal weather variation on the likely success of our Surf and Ice Cream shop I performed an analysis on 7 year's worth of data.  I looked in particular for a quantifiable difference between the beginning of summer (June) and the beginning of winter (December).  I examined both preciptation, in the form of measurable rainfall arocss the island, as well as temperatures, as reported by 9 weather stations spread across Oahu, ranging in elevation from 0 to 1000 feet above sea level.  
Raw statistics are provided below.  Note that only days/stations with measurable rainfall amounts are included in the precipitation counts.

## Our analysis concluded that the winters on Oahu are pretty darn nice.  Note that mean temperature drops only 4 degrees between June and December, still averaging over 70 degrees.  variability is also surprisingly consistent across the seasons, with the June standard deviation being just over 3, and the December value being just under 4.  Rainfall is also fairly consistent across seasons.  Both June and December are prone to having the odd large storm blow through which creates statistical outliers that skew the mean above the 3rd quartile.  December does have slightly more variation than June, however, with a higher standard deviation that goes along with having a higher mean as well as fewer recorded rainy days.

## My conclusion is that practically every day is an ice cream day on Oahu.  Sales should not be adversely affected in winter, as the temperatures only drop about 4 degress compared to June.  One minor factor is the elevated chances of a rain-out day in December due the rare major storm that passes through that time of year.

## Further Analysis could be done on all 12 months to determine if there is ever an unpleasant month on Oahu, or if there is a prefered month to close the shop in anticipation of reduced sales.  Additionally, expansion to the Big island may be something to consider if expansion opportunities present themselves.  Weather data from the island of Hawaii would need to factor in elevation constraints since we would not our data skewed by mountain weather stations.
